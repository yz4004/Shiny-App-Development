+ **Project summary**: By analyzing the data from multiple NYC agency sources, our shiny application can demonstrate the impact of Covid-19 on people's daily life at New York city. Our applications reveals a large shift of people's life including living style, people's financial status, living condition, count of arrests and vaccine distribution since the explosion of Covid-19 virus.
+ In our application, we divided our data exploration into 5 categories, including 311 service request [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9), homeless shelters and hospitals, arrest records, cases and vaccination distributions and salary and working hours of goverment agency employee (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e). These aspects are all highly related to people's daily livelihood and therefore we can analyze these data to help us better understand influence of Covid 19. These will help us know how to better improve people's living standard given this major life change.
