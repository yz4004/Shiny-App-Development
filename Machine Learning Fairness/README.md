+ Project summary: In this project, we will implement and compare algorithms handling Disparate Treatment & Mistreatment as well as Conditional Discrimination. Implementation and evaluation will be based on the COMPAS dataset, which contains the defendants' recidivsim risk score (COMPAS), race, gender, age, criminal history, prison time, etc. Our goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of the above algorithms.
